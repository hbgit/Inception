Method Goal:
	- What is the main goal of the proposed method?
		ANS: Generate data (variable value) to Daikon invariant genaration
		
	- How does it works?
		ANS: Intrument the analyzed C program with assert(0) to generate data input 
		to Daikon, but the test with assert(0) should be able to take into
		account the MCDC coverage condition
	  
	- Where is need to insert the asserts(0)?
		ANS: In each control flow struture, but we should avoid to add
		asserts(0) in the last part of control components (if,while,...)
		when the line before the actual line is not a assignment or Decl.
		In loop structures the assert shoul be added after the loop.
		
	- FOR FUTURE:
		ANS: We can adopt http://pathcrawler-online.com to run more test, if the 
		verification if the asserts(0) take a longer time, but in this case we 
		could adopt the test driver generated by pathcrawler.
	  
	  


Preliminary tests to build the method:

(1) Create test cases (with asserts(0)) to take the MCDC coverage condition
